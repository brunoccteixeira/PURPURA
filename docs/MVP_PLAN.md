## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| OS-Climate tools not Brazil-ready | Medium | Keep LLM fallback; adapt data sources |
| Physrisk learning curve too steep | Medium | Start with simple scenarios; reference docs |
| Frontend complexity delays delivery | High | Use minimal UI; focus on core workflows |
| Pilot customers not ready | Medium | Use Colab for distribution; have backup pilots |
| API performance issues | Low | Implement caching (Redis); async processing |
| Data quality problems | High | Human-in-the-loop validation UI; confidence scores |

---
